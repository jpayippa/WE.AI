Title: What is Academic Advising?
Content:
Located in Spencer Engineering Building, Room 2097, Engineering's First Year advisors have an in-depth knowledge of Western’s policies and procedures. They are here to help you navigate some of the administrative steps required to achieve your academic goals. These steps may include:
- Interpretation of policies, academic regulations and procedures.
- Program progression changes, including withdrawal from the University.
- Special permissions (e.g., course overloads, letter of permission, and Affiliate requests).
We also help students assess their situation and review their options if they are struggling to fulfill their academic responsibilities. Some examples include:
- Academic consideration for missed course work.
- Advice about flexible programming options to fit your needs.
- Advice about progression requirements, including students who are on a Dean's Waiver or those who have been required to withdraw due to poor academic performance.
- Guidance about program planning and degree choices within Engineering.
We also help students connect with other support resources here on campus. If you have questions and you don't know where to begin, come see us.
Our academic advisors work closely with students and value their privacy. As such, advisors will not discuss any student’s situation with other people on their behalf, unless the student has authorized us to release information to a third party.
